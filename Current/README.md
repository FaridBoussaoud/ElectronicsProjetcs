## Objectives 

[ ] *Current Measuremen*

	- Design a circuit capable of accurately measuring electrical current while maintaining system integrity.
    - Integrate a current sensor compatible with Arduino and establish communication with MATLAB Simulink.
  	- Develop a user interface to visualize real-time current data.
    - Conduct tests to assess the accuracy and responsiveness of the current measurement system under variable load conditions.
	- Validate the performance of the current measurement system by comparing measurements with a reference multimeter.
