## Contents

The contents of the directory are as follows : 

*  Setting up a *temperature* measurement system.

	* With *DALLAS DS18B20* sensor

	* With *DHT11* sensor ( Temperature + Humidity)

	* With *Thermistor* NTC MF52 

## Objectives 

[ ] *Temperature measurement*

	- Set up an electronic circuit capable of accurately measuring ambient temperature.
	- Integrate a temperature sensor compatible with Arduino and configure communication with MATLAB Simulink.
	- Develop a simple user interface to display real-time temperature data.
	- Test the stability and accuracy of the temperature measurement system in different environments.
