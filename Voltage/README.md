The contents of the directory are as follows : 

*  Setting up a *voltage* measurement system.

	* Voltage =< 5V

	* Voltage >= 5V ( Voltage Divider)


## Objectives 


 *Voltage Measurement*

	- Design a circuit capable of safely and accurately measuring electrical voltage.
	- Integrate a voltage sensor compatible with Arduino and establish communication with MATLAB Simulink.
    - Validate the performance of the voltage measurement system by comparing measurements with a reference multimeter.
